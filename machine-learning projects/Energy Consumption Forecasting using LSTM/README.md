# ðŸ”Œ Energy Consumption Forecasting using LSTM

This project is a time series forecasting model that predicts hourly energy consumption using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks. The goal is to explore how historical usage patterns, day-of-week, and contextual notes (like weekends or lockdowns) can help forecast future electricity demand.

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

Forecasting energy demand helps in:
- Better resource allocation
- Reducing power shortages
- Planning maintenance
- Managing grid load during holidays or lockdowns

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

- **Columns Used**:  
  - `Value (kWh)` â€“ Actual energy usage
  - `day_of_week` â€“ Day mapped as 0 (Monday) to 6 (Sunday)
  - `notes` â€“ Categorical labels such as 'weekend', 'vacation', 'COVID_lockdown'
  
- **Preprocessing Steps**:
  - Label Encoding of `notes`
  - MinMax Normalization of `Value (kWh)`
  - Sliding Window Technique (window size = 24) to feed time-series sequences to the model

## ðŸ§  Model Architecture

- **Model Type**: LSTM (Recurrent Neural Network)
- **Input Shape**: `(24, 3)` â†’ 24 time steps, 3 features (kWh, day_of_week, notes_encoded)
- **Layers**:
  - LSTM (50 units, relu activation)
  - Dense (1 output neuron for kWh prediction)
- **Loss Function**: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Epochs**: 10
- **Batch Size**: 32

## ðŸ“ˆ Results

![Actual vs Predicted Plot](download.png)
- The model successfully captures energy usage trends with reasonably good accuracy using simple feature like`day_of_week` and `notes`.

## ðŸ’¡ Future Improvements

- Add external features like temperature, holidays, or seasonality
- Try other models like GRU, BiLSTM, or Transformers
- Hyperparameter tuning with Optuna or GridSearchCV
- Real-time data streaming with model deployment
