# Logistic Regression From Scratch

This repository contains a simple implementation of logistic regression using Python and NumPy, built from scratch without any machine learning libraries.

## About

This project helped me understand the fundamentals of logistic regression and gradient descent. The concepts are inspired by Andrew Ng's [Machine Learning course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning), which I studied to learn the theory and math behind it.

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/logistic-regression-from-scratch.git
   cd logistic-regression-from-scratch
